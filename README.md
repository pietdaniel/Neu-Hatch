## Current Status

9.15.15
- server side pass one done with Flask-Login
- going to need to set up nginx from here on out, this will go server side

### Backend

- oauth 1.1 has been implemented
- this is not client side application only auth which will most likely hit rate limits
- this is per user authorization which requires server side query for security reasons
 - access_token/secret should not be sent to client side
 - client side storage of application keys is not secure
- a hack (crossdomain decorator) is used currently for testing because i dont want to set up a local nginx instance
 - this should be removed when we grab a domain/server and run with nginx
 - probably could have a better pattern here

### Frontend

- updated 2.15.15, search works
- todo : session management
